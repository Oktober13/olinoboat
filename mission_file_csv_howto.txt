Inside of mission_file.csv you should see something like

1, 0, 42, -71
1, 0, 42.00001, -71.00001

This corresponds to

'type of mission', 'information passing parameter', 'goal_latitude', 'goal_longitude'

The boat will try to sail to the (latitude, longitude) point (42, -71), then the point (42.00001, -71.00001)

In the first pass of sailbot code, we will be doing a simple waypoint follower, which will correspond with 'type of mission' = 1. For a simple waypoint follower, we won't need to pass any information, so the 'information passing parameter' will be set to 0 and not referenced.

The reason mission_file.csv has these unused parameters, instead of just GPS waypoints, is so that in the future new behaviors can be created. If you wanted to make the boat round a buoy, for example, you have two options. You could
	1) make three waypoints around the buoy and have the boat follow them using the waypoint following mission
	2) create a new behavior (round buoy) that uses the mission_file.csv info in another way
		- For example, you could pass the line '2, 1, 42.000000001, -71.0000000001'
		- The '2' (type of mission) could mean you are doing a 'round buoy' mission instead of a 'go to waypoint' mission
		- The '1' (information passing parameter) could mean 'round the buoy clockwise' and another value, perhaps 2, could mean 'round the buoy counterclockwise'
		- Now inside of read_mission.py you can write code that will take the single mission_file.csv line and reinterpret it into 3 correct waypoints
